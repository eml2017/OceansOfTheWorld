		<tr><td><p id="info">The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the oceans, with an area of 165.25 million square kilometers. It is filled with many underwater volcanoes and oceanic trenches. The climate varies from frigid winds near Russia to tropical sunshine near Hawaii. The Pacific holds large reefs, such as the Great Barrier Reef by Australia. The ocean also holds many islands, such as Greenland, Fiji, New Guniea, and the Mariana Islands.</p></td>
		<td><p id="info">The S-shaped Atlantic Ocean spreads from western Europe to Antarctica. The climate is mainly influenced by the winds and water currents. Weather is subtropical with low rainfall and high evaporation. The large fish population supplies work for fisherman along the African, European, North and South American coasts. Other marine wildlife includes eels, lobsters, and whales. The ocean also holds the Bermuda Triangle (an area of water where numerous ships have mysteriously dissapeared).</p></td>
		<td><p id="info">Surrounded by Asian countries and filled with tropical animals, the Indian Ocean offers picturesque scenery for all those who visit. It is the warmest of the four oceans, being as it passes directly through the equator. Its currents are controlled by monsoon (strong winds that are accompanied by changes in precipitation). Turtles, plankton, tuna, seals, and whales dwell in the warm waters. It also serves as trading routes for Middle Eastern, African, and Asain countries.</p></td>
		<td><p id="info">The Arctic Ocean, the smallest of the four, is located in the Arctic north polar region. Most of the ocean is covered by ice, which is currently melting and thinning at a rapid pace. Endangered animal and marine species (such as polar bears, walruses, whales) live in the fridgid Arctic waters. Glaciers and icebergs float throughout the ocean, and create dangerous obsticales to ships passing through.</p></td></tr>
